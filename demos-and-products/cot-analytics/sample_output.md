# Chain of Thought Plan for Data Analysis

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning:
   Hypothesis: N/A
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Remove or replace any missing values, standardize the data, and ensure the format is consistent across all columns. For example, replace the '?' values in 'workclass' and 'occupation' columns and ensure all categorical variables are encoded properly.

2. Descriptive statistics:
   Hypothesis: N/A
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Calculate basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables. This step will help in understanding the overall data distribution and any trends or patterns that may exist.

3. Correlation analysis:
   Hypothesis: Certain sociodemographic factors are correlated with income.
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Calculate correlation coefficients between continuous variables and income (you may need to convert income into a binary format for this). This will help in identifying which variables are most strongly associated with income.

4. Feature importance using Random Forests:
   Hypothesis: Some sociodemographic factors are more important in predicting income than others.
   Variables: All columns except 'income'
   Task: Fit a Random Forest classifier to the data to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of the 'income' variable. This will help in understanding which factors carry the most weight in contributing to income inequality.

5. Group analysis:
   Hypothesis: Different groups of people have distinct income distributions.
   Variables: Categorical columns like 'sex', 'race', 'marital.status', 'education'
   Task: Segment the data based on each categorical variable and analyze the income distribution within each group. This will help in understanding any potential disparities across various groups.

6. Multiple linear regression:
   Hypothesis: Certain combinations of sociodemographic factors predict income levels.
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Fit a multiple linear regression model to the data using 'income' as the dependent variable and all other variables as independent variables. This will help in understanding the relationships among variables and how they influence income levels.

7. Model evaluation:
   Hypothesis: The regression model has a certain level of predictive accuracy.
   Variables: N/A
   Task: Evaluate the regression model from step 6 using performance metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. This will help in gauging the accuracy of the model's predictions and identify potential areas for model improvement.

8. Logistic regression model:
   Hypothesis: Certain sociodemographic factors can be used to predict the probability of having an income above 50K.
   Variables: All columns except 'income'
   Task: Convert the 'income' variable into a binary format (1 if '>50K' and 0 if '<=50K') and fit a logistic regression model using the binary 'income' as the dependent variable and all other variables as independent variables. Calculate the odds ratios for each independent variable to understand their contribution towards predicting individuals with an income greater than 50K.

9. Model evaluation:
   Hypothesis: The logistic regression model has a certain level of predictive accuracy.
   Variables: N/A
   Task: Evaluate the logistic regression model from step 8 using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. This will help in gauging the accuracy of the model's predictions and identify potential areas for model improvement.

# Code for Step #1

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning:
   Hypothesis: N/A
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Remove or replace any missing values, standardize the data, and ensure the format is consistent across all columns. For example, replace the '?' values in 'workclass' and 'occupation' columns and ensure all categorical variables are encoded properly.

```python
# Identify columns with missing values represented by '?'
missing_value_columns = ['workclass', 'occupation', 'native.country']

# Replace '?' values with NaN
for col in missing_value_columns:
    df[col] = df[col].replace('?', np.nan)

# Drop rows with missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Encode categorical variables using pandas get_dummies function
categorical_columns = ['workclass', 'education', 'marital.status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native.country']
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=categorical_columns, drop_first=True)

# Standardize continuous variables
continuous_variables = ['age', 'fnlwgt', 'education.num', 'capital.gain', 'capital.loss', 'hours.per.week']
for var in continuous_variables:
    df[var] = (df[var] - df[var].mean()) / df[var].std()

# Convert income into binary format (1 for '>50K' and 0 for '<=50K')
df['income'] = df['income'].map({'>50K': 1, '<=50K': 0})
```


# Code for Step #2

2. Descriptive statistics:
   Hypothesis: N/A
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Calculate basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables. This step will help in understanding the overall data distribution and any trends or patterns that may exist.

```python
# Calculate basic descriptive statistics for continuous variables
continuous_variables_descriptive_stats = df[continuous_variables].describe()
print("Descriptive statistics for continuous variables:\n", continuous_variables_descriptive_stats)

# Calculate mode for continuous variables
continuous_variables_mode = df[continuous_variables].mode().T
print("\nMode for continuous variables:\n", continuous_variables_mode)

# Calculate frequency distributions for original categorical variables (before encoding)
categorical_columns_frequency = df[categorical_columns].apply(pd.Series.value_counts)
print("\nFrequency distributions for categorical variables:\n", categorical_columns_frequency)
```


# Code for Step #3

3. Correlation analysis:
   Hypothesis: Certain sociodemographic factors are correlated with income.
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Calculate correlation coefficients between continuous variables and income (you may need to convert income into a binary format for this). This will help in identifying which variables are most strongly associated with income.

```python
# Calculate correlation coefficients between continuous variables and income
correlation_matrix = df[continuous_variables + ['income']].corr()

# Get correlation coefficients for 'income'
income_correlations = correlation_matrix['income']

# Print correlation coefficients
print("Correlation coefficients between continuous variables and income:\n", income_correlations)
```


# Code for Step #4

4. Feature importance using Random Forests:
   Hypothesis: Some sociodemographic factors are more important in predicting income than others.
   Variables: All columns except 'income'
   Task: Fit a Random Forest classifier to the data to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of the 'income' variable. This will help in understanding which factors carry the most weight in contributing to income inequality.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Separate the target variable ('income') from predictor variables
X = df.drop(columns='income')
y = df['income']

# Fit a Random Forest classifier
random_forest_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
random_forest_classifier.fit(X, y)

# Calculate feature importances
feature_importances = random_forest_classifier.feature_importances_

# Sort the features by their importance and print them along with their importance values
sorted_features = sorted(zip(feature_importances, X.columns), reverse=True)
print("Feature Importances using Random Forest:\n")
for importance, feature in sorted_features:
    print(f"{feature}: {importance}")
```


# Code for Step #5

5. Group analysis:
   Hypothesis: Different groups of people have distinct income distributions.
   Variables: Categorical columns like 'sex', 'race', 'marital.status', 'education'
   Task: Segment the data based on each categorical variable and analyze the income distribution within each group. This will help in understanding any potential disparities across various groups.

```python
# Segmentation by 'sex'
sex_income_dist = df.groupby('sex')['income'].mean()
print("Income distribution by sex:\n", sex_income_dist)

# Segmentation by 'race'
race_income_dist = df.groupby('race')['income'].mean()
print("\nIncome distribution by race:\n", race_income_dist)

# Segmentation by 'marital.status'
marital_status_income_dist = df.groupby('marital.status')['income'].mean()
print("\nIncome distribution by marital status:\n", marital_status_income_dist)

# Segmentation by 'education'
education_income_dist = df.groupby('education')['income'].mean()
print("\nIncome distribution by education:\n", education_income_dist)
```

Please note that these calculations assume that the original categorical variables have been restored in the dataframe `df`. If you have already converted the categorical variables to numerical format using one-hot encoding, you will need to create a separate dataframe with the original categorical variables for this step.

# Code for Step #6

6. Multiple linear regression:
   Hypothesis: Certain combinations of sociodemographic factors predict income levels.
   Variables: All columns
   Task: Fit a multiple linear regression model to the data using 'income' as the dependent variable and all other variables as independent variables. This will help in understanding the relationships among variables and how they influence income levels.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Separate the target variable ('income') from predictor variables
X = df.drop(columns='income')
y = df['income']

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Fit a multiple linear regression model
linear_regression = LinearRegression()
linear_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate predictions for the test set
y_pred = linear_regression.predict(X_test)

# Print linear regression coefficients for each independent variable
print("Multiple linear regression coefficients:\n")
for coef, feature in zip(linear_regression.coef_, X.columns):
    print(f"{feature}: {coef}")
```


# Code for Step #7

7. Model evaluation:
   Hypothesis: The regression model has a certain level of predictive accuracy.
   Variables: N/A
   Task: Evaluate the regression model from step 6 using performance metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. This will help in gauging the accuracy of the model's predictions and identify potential areas for model improvement.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

# Calculate R-squared
r_squared = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r_squared}")

# Calculate Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Calculate Mean Absolute Error
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
```


# Code for Step #8

8. Logistic regression model:
   Hypothesis: Certain sociodemographic factors can be used to predict the probability of having an income above 50K.
   Variables: All columns except 'income'
   Task: Convert the 'income' variable into a binary format (1 if '>50K' and 0 if '<=50K') and fit a logistic regression model using the binary 'income' as the dependent variable and all other variables as independent variables. Calculate the odds ratios for each independent variable to understand their contribution towards predicting individuals with an income greater than 50K.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Separate the target variable ('income') from predictor variables
X = df.drop(columns='income')
y = df['income']

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Fit a logistic regression model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression()
logistic_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate odds ratios for each independent variable
odds_ratios = np.exp(logistic_regression.coef_).flatten()

# Print odds ratios for each independent variable
print("Odds Ratios for independent variables:\n")
for odds_ratio, feature in zip(odds_ratios, X.columns):
    print(f"{feature}: {odds_ratio}")
```
