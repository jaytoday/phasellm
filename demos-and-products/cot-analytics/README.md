# Chain of Thought (CoT) Analytics

This generates a Chain of Thought (CoT) plan for a data set, and then asks the LLM to generate code for each step in the CoT analysis.

Curious about the output? Please see `sample_output.md` for an example of an analysis plan for the demo data set. This was not edited!

## Installation and Setup

### Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the folder containing this README.md file. Install the relevant packages (including PhaseLLM):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, make sure you edit the `cot.py` file to include the proper API keys. You'll find these around line 115:
```python
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") 
o = OpenAIGPTWrapper(openai_api_key, 'gpt-4') # We highly recommend using GPT-4 or Claude v1.3 for this.
```

### Running With Sample Data

Simply run `cot.py` directly in your command line. This will take a while to run, and will make 10-20 requests to the OpenAI or Anthropic API.

## Running on Your Own Data

This demo is based on the data in `incomes.csv` in the `researchllm` folder. We are working on making this easier to apply to other data sets *and* to actually execute the code generated by the LLM.

Until then, please don't hesitate to reach out -- hello (at) phaseai (dot) com -- and we'll help you apply this to your data.
